<h1> Penalty Shootout</h1>

In this project I will be creating a penalty shootout game.
The game will work by having a grid which is located over the goal, the user will determine where they shoot by selecting a grid-square.
After clicking on the grid square, the penalty taker will have their shot go to that location.
There will be a goal keeper which attempts to save the shot by moving in a random direction.
The goal keeper will learn the players moves as time goes on.
