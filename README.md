<h1> Penalty Shootout</h1>

In this project I will be creating a penalty shootout game.
The game will work by having a grid which is located over the goal, the user will determine where they shoot by selecting a grid-square.
After clicking on the grid square, the penalty taker will have their shot go to that location.
There will be a goal keeper which attempts to save the shot by moving in a random direction.
The goal keeper will learn the players moves as time goes on.

How does goal keeper learn? 
• If you go to a certain corner, then he is more likely to go there?

How to add to the game? 
• Having two teams that compete in a penalty shootout?
• Having goal keepers of different difficulty levels?
• How can one goalkeeper be more advanced than another goalkeeper?
• Having levels? Level 1 ? Level 2 ? Level 3 ?
•
